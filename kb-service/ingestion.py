"""
ingestion.py — the actual knowledge-base mechanics. Everything here is an
internal implementation detail of this service; app.py is the only public
surface (POST /ingest, GET /search, etc.). The Node chat backend should
never import this module directly, only call the HTTP API.

Multi-tenancy: ONE shared Qdrant collection (config.QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME),
not one per tenant. Every point carries a flat top-level `tenantId` payload
field (verified empirically against LlamaIndex's actual QdrantVectorStore
output, not a guess), with a tenant-optimized payload index (`is_tenant=True`
+ `hnsw_config(m=0, payload_m=16)`, per Qdrant's own multi-tenancy guidance)
so tenants' vectors are co-located on disk instead of scattered across a
single global HNSW graph. search() is the ONLY read path and it is
structurally required to filter by tenantId — there is no code path that
queries the shared collection without it. The `is_tenant` payload index is
a documented no-op on embedded/local Qdrant mode (dev); filtering
correctness still works locally regardless, the disk co-location
performance benefit only shows up on real server/cloud Qdrant.

Section-aware chunking: a file is no longer always one document. If the
file declares its own Table of Contents (a "Table of Contents" / "Contents"
line followed by a run of "1. Heading", "2. Heading", ... lines — the
pattern used by these knowledge-base exports), each TOC entry becomes its
own document before chunking, so SentenceSplitter can never blend two
different topics into one chunk. Files without that structure fall back to
being treated as one whole document, exactly as before — this can only
improve chunking quality, never make it worse, for files that don't have a
detectable TOC.

Because of this, one filename can now map to MULTIPLE underlying doc_ids
(one per detected section, or a single one for files without a TOC). The
registry tracks which doc_ids currently belong to each filename so that
re-uploading an edited file (a section renamed/removed/added) or deleting a
file cleans up every chunk that file is responsible for, not just one.
Every doc_id is prefixed "<tenantId>::..." regardless — combined with the
mandatory tenantId filter above, a delete/dedup operation for one tenant's
doc_id can never touch another tenant's points even in the shared
collection.
